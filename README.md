# A simple Obsctacle Game 
This game is the first game I created with Unity.

The main idea of the creation of this game is to understand basic scripting and basic collider managing.

Obstacle game is just a one level game. The player, Kuby, tries to reach the finishing point without colliding with obstacles in the field. If Kuby collides with an obstacle the counter goes up.
