# A simple Obsctacle Game 
This game is the first game I created with Unity.

The main idea of the creation of this game is to understand basic scripting, basic collider managing and simply using Unity camera package, Cinemachine.

Obstacle game is just a one level game. The player, Kuby, tries to reach the finishing point without colliding with obstacles in the field. If Kuby collides with an obstacle the counter goes up.
